# Mapit
A simple yet powerfull api client.

## Reasons to create
I truly love postman, I've tried every other API client out there, literally looked at [this](https://github.com/stepci/awesome-api-clients) list and tried every single one.

But except Postman, and EchoAPI, None of them had all of the features I need.\
Some didn't even say the response size or the response time. Crazy, I know.\
Others, although Open-Source, had premium plan for a Git UI.

The problem with EchoAPI was different tho, it had all of the features I needed and more (a lot of AI BS), but it was
super slow. There really should be no reason for an API client to be slow.\
So here I chose technologies like NwJS instead of Electron so it would be fast.

The problem with postman, is that it needs you to register. And because it is not an Open-Source project, You have to
pay for all of the features, like, why? It is just a glorified `curl` command...



Mapit, is suppose to solve these problems.
It should just be easy to create and save requests

## Tasks
- [ ] Different ways to view response (raw, pretty)
- [ ] Show response headers
- [ ] File explorer
- [ ] convert request to different types of program languages
- [ ] show that request is pending
